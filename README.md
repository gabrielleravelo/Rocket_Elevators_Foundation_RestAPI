# README

This week, we worked about API. We created RestApi for our website


 

## Install

To create the REST API, it is necessary to use the following tutorial: 
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio

We can install this package in .NET Core application using NuGet package manager:

Microsoft doesn't have official package to support MySQL data provider for EF Core (yet). With this package we can make the connection to the Mysql database. 
After the coding of the API we do the deploy in the azure.

To do the deploy we have to create an account in azure portal:
