# README

This week, the project is about to add a form for action requests. A RestAPi is used for the following actions:
- get all interventions with a Pending status
- update the start date of intervention and the status for InProgress
- update the end date of the intervention and the status for completed


## Install
In the project folder, an intervention controller file and an intervention model file have been added.
